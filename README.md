# Street Art Orlando iOS App

Orlando is home to hundreds of vibrant murals and street art works. The thing is people mostly know how to find these public works by either stumbling upon them while wandering the city or by word of mouth. Plus they tend to be repainted after a short period of time. The Street Art Orlando app helps people curate the amazing street murals, art and graffiti throughout the Orlando area. 

The app is available for download in the App Store. 

**Project Status**
